Cold Storage Connectivity: A network of cold storage options to preserve perishable goods, accessible through the platform.

Transport Systems Integration: Linking farmers with reliable transportation services to ensure timely delivery.

Customer Interaction: Tools for farmers to communicate directly with buyers for personalized services and feedback.

Expected Results: By streamlining the farm-to-table process, Kisaan Mitra aims to:

Enhance farmers’ incomes through direct sales.

Minimize post-harvest losses with efficient cold storage and transport systems.

Foster a transparent and sustainable agricultural market.

Encourage technological adoption in rural communities.
